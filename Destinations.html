    <h2>Mayon Volcano</h2>
    <img src="destination cagsawa.jpg" alt="Cagsawa Ruins">
    <p>
     Cagsawa Ruins, located in Daraga, Albay, is one of the most iconic historical landmarks in the Bicol Region. 
     What remains of the old Cagsawa Church, its belfry standing solemnly against the backdrop of the majestic Mayon Volcano tells 
     a powerful story of resilience. The church was destroyed by the violent eruption of Mayon in 1814, burying hundreds in lava and ash. 
     Today, the site serves not only as a reminder of nature’s power but also as a symbol of the strength and spirit of the Bicolanos. 
     It’s a must-visit for history lovers, photographers, and anyone wanting a scenic and meaningful travel experience.
